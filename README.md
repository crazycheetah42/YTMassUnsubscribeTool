# YTMassUnsubscriber
YT Mass Unsubscriber is a tool I built that can unsubscribe from your YouTube channels. It uses the Google Cloud YT API's delete function to unsubscribe from your channels. Therefore, it needs a client-secret.json file to work.
# Getting the client-secret.json file
Getting the client-secret.json file is pretty simple.
Here's the overview of what you need to do:
* Create a Google Cloud project and setup the app.
* Download the client-secret.json file
* Add it to the program
<br>
That's all. Three easy steps. The program also has a link to a quick 3-minute video which goes more in-depth of how to create the project and download the file.

Do note that if you are using the Google Cloud free API, you will only get 200 channels unsubscribed each day, so if you have more you can either pay or wait for the next day.
