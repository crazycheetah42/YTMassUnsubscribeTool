# YTMassUnsubscriber
YT Mass Unsubscriber is a tool which uses the official Google Cloud YT API - specifically, the YouTube Data v3 API, to unsubscribe from any YouTube channels you may be subscribed to.
This tool is written in Python and provides a simple GUI achieved with the help of tkinter. All you need to do is to add the project in your Google Cloud Account (easy) and then download the client-secret.json file.
Then, insert it using the app's built-in function and the app will open a Authentication dialog, and you need to click Allow to give the app permissions to unsubscribe from your accounts.
# Getting the client-secret.json file
Getting the client-secret.json file is pretty simple.
Here's the overview of what you need to do:
* Create a Google Cloud project and setup the app.
* Download the client-secret.json file
* Add it to the program
<br>
That's all. Three easy steps. The program also has a link to a quick 3-minute video which goes more in-depth of how to create the project and download the file.

Do note that if you are using the Google Cloud free API, you will only get 200 channels unsubscribed each day, so if you have more you can either pay or wait for the next day.
